# Cricket World Cup 2023 Analysis
  
## Description
This is the project of group 6 for the course MTH208. In this project we have scraped the dataset from various sites containing data of players who will be playing the world cup, and tried to get some insights into what players will play a vital role in the world cup and how strong each team is at the start of the tournament. Along with that, we have also built an app using `Shiny` package in R Studio for analyzing data in an interactive way.

## Contents
- **Scraping** : This folder contains all the code for scraping data
- **Data pre processing** : This folder contains all the code for cleaning datasets, combining 2 datasets and making plots.
- The **Presentation** folder includes the ppt file we created to explain our analysis, as well as a brief video demonstration of our app on the final slide.
- The **Project Report** folder in the project contains a markdown file that contains all the results and conclusion from the data analysis we performed. The html format of the report is also interactive.
- **Shiny App** : Shiny is a R package that makes it easier to build interactive web pages from R.
- **Requirements** : Run this file if any package is not installed beforehand.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
## Instruction to run the code:
- For running code please set the respective parent folder as working directory.
- The qualification probability might take some time to load in the app and the markdown file, but it will load eventually.
